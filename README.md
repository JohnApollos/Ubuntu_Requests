### Features

-   **Multiple URL Handling**: The program can process a single image URL or multiple URLs separated by a comma.
-   **File Management**: It automatically creates a `Fetched_Images` directory and saves all downloaded images there.
-   **Robust Error Handling**: The script gracefully handles common issues like bad URLs, network timeouts, and non-image content.
-   **Duplicate Prevention**: Uses a content hash to check for and skip images that have already been downloaded.
-   **Content Validation**: Validates the `Content-Type` to ensure it is an image and checks `Content-Length` to prevent downloading excessively large files.

-   **Effective error handling**: It uses `try-except` blocks to handle `requests.exceptions.RequestException` and other errors.

-   **Appropriate file management**: It uses `os.makedirs` and `os.path.join` to manage directories and file paths correctly.
